# Flickr to Google Photos CLI

A command-line tool for transferring photo albums from Flickr to Google Photos while preserving metadata, descriptions, and location information.

## Features

- üñºÔ∏è Transfer entire photo albums from Flickr to Google Photos
- üìù Preserve photo descriptions and metadata
- üìç Maintain location information (GPS coordinates)
- üè∑Ô∏è Keep photo tags and titles
- üìä Progress tracking and job status monitoring
- üîÑ Batch processing for large albums
- üß™ Dry-run mode for testing
- ‚ö° Resume interrupted transfers

## Prerequisites

Before using this tool, you'll need export your Flickr data and set up API access for Google Photos:

### Flickr Setup

1. [Download all your Flickr content as one or more zip files](https://www.flickrhelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404079675156-Downloading-content-from-Flickr#h_01K2YYSY0GQ4T8PXC8B47HQ97T)

### Google Photos API Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google Photos Library API
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
5. Note down your Client ID and Client Secret
6. Set up OAuth consent screen if needed

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd flickr-to-google-cli
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

4. Make the CLI globally available (optional):

```bash
npm link
```

## Configuration

Run the setup command to configure your API credentials:

```bash
npm run dev setup
```

This will prompt you for:

- Google OAuth Client ID
- Google OAuth Client Secret

Your credentials will be stored in `.flickr-to-google.json` in your project directory.

## Usage

### List Flickr Albums

View all your Flickr albums:

```bash
npm run dev list-albums
```

Or for a specific user:

```bash
npm run dev list-albums --user <username>
```

### Transfer Albums

Transfer all albums:

```bash
npm run dev transfer
```

Transfer a specific album:

```bash
npm run dev transfer --album <album-id>
```

Transfer with custom options:

```bash
npm run dev transfer --album <album-id> --batch-size 5 --dry-run
```

### Check Transfer Status

View all transfer jobs:

```bash
npm run dev status
```

Check a specific job:

```bash
npm run dev status --job-id <job-id>
```

## Command Options

### `transfer` command options:

- `--album <albumId>`: Transfer a specific album by ID
- `--user <username>`: Flickr username (if different from configured)
- `--dry-run`: Preview what would be transferred without actually transferring
- `--batch-size <size>`: Number of photos to process in each batch (default: 10)

### `list-albums` command options:

- `--user <username>`: Flickr username to list albums for

### `status` command options:

- `--job-id <jobId>`: Check status of a specific transfer job

## How It Works

1. **Authentication**: The tool uses your API credentials to authenticate Google Photos
2. **Album Discovery**: Reads your Flickr albums and their metadata
3. **Upload to Google Photos**: Uploads photos to Google Photos with preserved metadata
4. **Album Creation**: Creates corresponding albums in Google Photos
5. **Progress Tracking**: Monitors transfer progress and saves job status

## Metadata Preservation

The tool preserves the following metadata during transfer:

- Photo titles and descriptions
- GPS location information (latitude/longitude)
- Photo dimensions and technical details
- Album titles
- Creation and upload dates

## Limitations

Flickr supports album descriptions, but Google does not. Therefore this tool cannot transfer your
Flickr album descriptions.

## Error Handling

- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for failed photo uploads
- **Progress Tracking**: Jobs are saved and can be resumed
- **Error Logging**: Detailed error messages for troubleshooting
- **Batch Processing**: Failed photos don't stop the entire transfer

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**
   - Verify your API credentials are correct
   - Ensure OAuth consent screen is properly configured for Google Photos
   - Check that the Google Photos Library API is enabled

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - The tool includes built-in rate limiting
   - Reduce batch size if you encounter rate limit errors
   - Use `--batch-size` option to control processing speed

3. **Large Albums**
   - Use smaller batch sizes for very large albums
   - Monitor progress with the `status` command
   - Consider using `--dry-run` first to estimate transfer time

```bash
DEBUG=1 npm run dev transfer
```
